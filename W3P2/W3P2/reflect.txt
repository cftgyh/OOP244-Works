1. What I have learned
	(1) I learned how to write class(include function declaration and definition), how to set functions as public(because class is private by default), and how to use the class functions in main function.

	(2) I also learned how to reasonably use 2 different classes and make them 
work together to get what I need. For example, use m_toy.setToys in Store::setToys, 
and use m_toy.display() in Store::display().

	(3) I learned how to use cout.fill... to fill my output with some chars, use cout.width... to set output width up, use cout.setf set left/right assignment, and use fixed << setprecision... to set precision of float type.


2. What difficulties I ever met in this workshop
	(1) One big difficulty I met is: how to assemble those 2 classes and their vars and functions, how to relate them to each other, so that it would work quickly, correctly and output the right output.

	(2) Another difficulty I met is: How to setEmpty for m_toy array. It's a toy array, and contains many details. So, I was a bit confused about how to set it to an empty state. Finally I choose to solve the problem by a for loop, and write m_toy[i] = {};.
