1. What I learned from the workshop

	(1) I learned how to override functions of parent class in child class correctly: 
	they must be of the same prototypes.

	(2) I learned how to write a class use as interface for its child and grandchild 
	classes. In header file, all of the functions' prototype in the class including 
	destructor, should be virtual. And destructor should set default, other member 
	functions should set =0.

 	(3) I learned the importance of "const" keyword: I wrote const in parent display 
	function, but not in child display function. It caused error and I can not even 
	compile the project. I finally found the defference and override them correctly.

2. What I think is difficult in the workshop

	(1) When overloading operation >> and << as helper functions, I use load() and play() as 
	instruction. However, it doesn't work (because child classes override functions haven't 
	created yet). I was very confused, and did many trials to get rid of error. I finally 
	found the reason and know I should ignore the error (it will disappear automatically 
	after I override virtual functions in child classes).
