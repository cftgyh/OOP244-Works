1. What I learned from the workshop

	(1) I learned how to open and close a file, how to read data from and file, and how to write data to a file.

 	(2) I learned how to write sort logic - sort a sequence of numbers from lower to higher.

	(3) I practiced my ability to write copy constructor and copy assignment

	(4) I learned how to use temp variable in function (istream& operator>>(istream& istr, Numbers& right)), 
	so that I can use operator+= overloaded function. 

2. What I think is difficult in the workshop

	(1) Because I am unfamiliar with deallocate memory a little, the difficuty I met in this workshop is to find the memory leak. 
		matrix notify me that the leak occurs in the load() function, so I checked this function again and again. 
		I also checked other places where memory leaks are easy to occur in case of unpreditable errors. To know the program 
		walkthrough more, I set a breakpoint and track the process carefully. 
		
		Finnaly, I found where the problem is: 
		if (noOfLines != count), I should (delete[] m_collection) by myself before setEmpty(). I didn't aware of this point, 
		so it caused a memory leak. I added (delete[] ,_collection), and then the error disappeared.
