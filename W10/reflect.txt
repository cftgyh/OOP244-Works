1. What I learned from the workshop

	(1) I learned how to write a template for different type and how to use the type symbol in the template function.

	(2) I learned how to use a template function in main function. Actually, the use of template function is of no difference with normal function, just call a template funtion like a normal function, and we can pass values of different types in it.
 
 	(3) I learned I can declare  and define template funtions in a different header file, and when I need to use it, just include the header file name. 

2. What I think is difficult in the workshop

	(1) We must make sure all test objects like minValue and test elements(testValues array) aren't be copied or modified in the function. In order to acchieve the goal, I thought a lot. To make sure values cannot be modified, I should set both minValie and testValues array const. However, "values aren't be copied", it took me time to understand this word. Finally, I found I should use pass by address instead of passing by value to do it.
