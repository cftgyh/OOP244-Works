1. What I learned from the workshop
	(1) I learned I can use the keyword: "protected" before parent functions, so they can be only 
	available for the class itself and its' child class.

	(2) I learned how to user parent class's public and protected functions in child class.

 	(3) I learned how to write the constructor function in child class: write initialization before {}.


2. What I think is difficult in the workshop

	(1) I didn't realize that the initialization of Pet should write before {}, so I wrote like: 
	Fish::Fish(const char* name, int initAge){
		Pet(name, initAge, cFishFee)
	}
so the output is weird.
and then I realized I should write like below: 
	Fish::Fish(const char* name, int initAge): Pet(name, initAge, cFishFee)	
	}

	(2) in function operator= of Pet.cpp, it says "In addition, when closing customers are to be charged 
	based on the fee table". 
	I did not understand the words, and I set m_totalAmount = p.m_noOfAmount. 
	The correct answer should be: set the m_totalAmout = 0 here, and add fee when cloning fish and dog.
