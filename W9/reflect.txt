1. What I learned from the workshop

	(1) I learned to use "m_name && m_name[0]" to check if m_name is exist, and if they aren't empty. 
	(m_name is a pointer and store name dynamicly.)

	(2) I learned I don't need to write anything in the constructor if I have initialized all of the 
	member data in the header file.

 	(3) I learned I can use std::istream to read data from file, unnecessarily need to write another 
	std::ifstream function.

2. What I think is difficult in the workshop

	(1) In Contact.cpp, I'm confused whether I need to include "Person::operator~();" in function
	void Contact::operator~()
	{
		delete[] m_address;
		delete[] m_city;
		m_address = m_city = nullptr;
	}
	I thought I didn't need it, because when the program end, the destructor of parent class Person will be 
	called automatically. However, if I didn't add it, there is memory leak. So, I went throught my codes, 
	and I found in read function, ~*this in both child and parent class will call Contact::operator~() -> 
	so no one calls Person::operator~(), that's why there is memory leak. So, I finally know I should add 
	"Person::operator~();".
